Edinburgh is one of the most dog-friendly cities in the UK, with a strong culture of pet ownership and excellent services to support it. Scotland's capital offers outstanding veterinary care, quality grooming salons, beautiful walking routes, and welcoming attitudes toward pets in many establishments. Whether you live in the New Town, Leith, Morningside, or the surrounding Lothians, quality pet care is readily available.

## Veterinary Care in Edinburgh

Edinburgh has a well-established network of veterinary practices serving pets across the city and Lothians. The presence of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies at the University of Edinburgh means the city benefits from world-class veterinary expertise and facilities, including a small animal hospital accepting referrals for complex cases.

Emergency veterinary services are essential knowledge for Edinburgh pet owners. Several practices offer out-of-hours care, and knowing your nearest emergency facility before you need it could save critical time in a crisis. Keep emergency contact details easily accessible in your phone, and familiarise yourself with the route before an emergency arises.

The Royal Dick Vet School Hospital provides specialist services including oncology, cardiology, neurology, and orthopaedics. While primarily a teaching hospital, it accepts referrals from local practices for cases requiring advanced diagnostics or specialist treatment. Your regular vet can arrange referrals when specialist attention is needed.

When choosing a veterinary practice in Edinburgh, consider the practice culture alongside practical factors. Look for practices where staff take time to explain options clearly, where consultations feel unhurried, and where both pets and owners are treated with genuine care. Recommendations from other pet owners often lead to finding practices that match your expectations.

Scotland has its own veterinary regulations, though practices must still be registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. The Scottish SPCA provides additional support and resources for pet owners across Edinburgh and Scotland.

## Dog Grooming Services

Edinburgh's grooming scene includes salons catering to every breed and budget, from practical neighbourhood groomers to luxury establishments offering spa-style treatments. The city has specialists in everything from Scottie dog hand-stripping to Poodle styling and everything between.

Independent grooming salons often deliver the most personalised service in Edinburgh. These smaller businesses frequently take fewer bookings per day, allowing groomers to spend quality time with each dog. Many Edinburgh independents have earned devoted client bases through consistent results and genuine fondness for their canine customers.

Mobile grooming services operate throughout Edinburgh and the Lothians, bringing complete grooming facilities directly to your door. This option suits anxious dogs who find travel or unfamiliar environments stressful, as well as owners with mobility limitations or busy schedules. Mobile grooming typically costs more than salon visits but eliminates transport logistics and waiting room stress.

Edinburgh grooming prices are competitive, though they vary depending on location, salon prestige, and coat requirements. Standard full grooms for medium-sized dogs typically range from £35 to £55. Larger breeds, heavily matted coats, or breed-specific show styling commands premium prices. Always confirm pricing before booking to avoid misunderstandings.

Before choosing a groomer, visit salons to assess cleanliness and atmosphere. Watch how staff interact with dogs and ask about their experience with your specific breed. Professional groomers welcome such questions and happily explain their methods and products.

## Dog Walking and Pet Sitting

Edinburgh's dog walking culture is strong, supported by the city's many parks, coastal paths, and green spaces. Professional dog walkers offer everything from quick lunchtime walks to full-day adventures in Edinburgh's stunning natural surroundings.

Group walks combine exercise with socialisation and are budget-friendly compared to individual walks. Edinburgh's responsible dog walkers maintain sensible group sizes, typically no more than four to six dogs, ensuring proper supervision. Ask potential walkers about their group policies and how they assess new dogs before joining established packs.

Solo walks suit dogs with particular needs, whether that involves reactivity issues, medical conditions requiring careful management, elderly dogs needing gentle exercise, or pets who simply prefer human company over canine socialisation. One-to-one walks cost more but ensure completely focused attention throughout.

Technology has enhanced Edinburgh's dog walking services, with GPS tracking and photo updates now standard among professional walkers. These features allow you to see your dog's route, distance covered, and highlights from their outing. Such transparency builds confidence that your dog is receiving quality care.

Pet sitting services in Edinburgh range from brief check-in visits to overnight stays, either in your home or the sitter's residence. Home boarding provides an alternative to traditional kennels, with your dog staying in a licensed carer's home environment. Edinburgh pet sitting typically costs £25 to £40 per night, varying by service type and seasonal demand.

## Pet Supplies and Shops

Edinburgh has excellent options for pet supplies, including national chains, garden centre pet departments, and independent specialists. The city has seen growth in shops focusing on premium, natural, and Scottish-sourced pet products.

Independent pet shops throughout Edinburgh often carry superior products and provide more knowledgeable advice than chain stores. Many specialise in particular areas such as raw feeding, natural supplements, or products suited to Scottish conditions. Building relationships with local independents connects you with tailored recommendations for your pet.

Raw feeding has gained followers across Edinburgh, supported by dedicated suppliers offering fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried raw food options. If exploring raw diets, specialist shops provide essential guidance on transition, nutritional balance, and safe food handling practices.

For everyday needs, convenience stores, supermarkets, and large pet chains offer basic supplies at competitive prices. Online shopping has expanded options further, with most products available for delivery throughout Edinburgh and the Lothians. However, for specialist items or expert guidance, local shops remain valuable resources.

## Boarding and Kennels

Edinburgh and the Lothians have numerous boarding facilities for pets whose owners travel or need emergency care. Options range from rural kennels with large exercise areas to smaller home boarding setups in residential areas.

Advance booking is essential for Edinburgh boarding facilities, especially during the Festival season, summer holidays, Christmas, and Easter. Edinburgh's position as a major tourist destination means local pet owners compete with visitors for boarding spaces. If you know your travel dates, book boarding as early as possible.

Home boarding has grown popular as an alternative to traditional kennels throughout the Lothians. Your pet stays in a licensed carer's home, enjoying a domestic environment rather than kennel accommodation. All Scottish home boarders must hold licences from their local council and meet welfare requirements.

Dog daycare facilities across Edinburgh provide supervised care and socialisation while owners work. These range from intimate home-based operations to larger dedicated facilities. Always visit daycare providers before enrolling, ensuring their setup suits your dog's temperament and their assessment processes properly evaluate suitability.

Catteries serving Edinburgh pets are found throughout the city and surrounding areas. When selecting a cattery, visit to assess cleanliness, temperature control, ventilation, and the behaviour of cats in residence. Relaxed, content cats indicate good care standards.

## Parks and Walking Routes

Edinburgh offers exceptional green spaces and walking opportunities, from city centre parks to coastal paths and nearby hills. The combination of urban parks and accessible countryside makes it ideal for dog owners.

Holyrood Park provides dramatic volcanic landscape within walking distance of the city centre. Arthur's Seat offers challenging hill walks with stunning views, while lower paths around the park suit dogs preferring easier terrain. Dogs must be kept under close control, especially near wildlife.

The Water of Leith Walkway stretches from Balerno to Leith, offering miles of peaceful riverside walking through the city. This linear route passes through woodland, former mills, and diverse neighbourhoods, providing varied scenery and surfaces for dogs.

Portobello Beach offers coastal exercise where dogs can run on the sand and swim in the sea during appropriate seasons. Check local regulations regarding seasonal restrictions and designated dog areas along the promenade.

The Pentland Hills Regional Park, just south of Edinburgh, provides extensive moorland and hill walking. These open spaces offer fantastic exercise for energetic dogs, though leads are essential near sheep and other livestock throughout the year.

Cramond and its associated walks along the River Almond provide another excellent option, with the added attraction of the causeway to Cramond Island at low tide. Always check tide times before crossing to the island to avoid being stranded.

## Training and Behaviour Services

Edinburgh has excellent dog training providers, from puppy socialisation classes to advanced training and behaviour consultancy. Scotland has its own community of certified trainers using modern, positive methods.

Puppy classes are essential for Edinburgh dogs, helping them build confidence in urban environments while learning crucial social skills. Quality puppy classes introduce young dogs to varied stimuli, surfaces, sounds, and both canine and human company in positive, controlled settings.

Adult training courses help with obedience fundamentals, recall reliability, and common behaviour challenges. Many Edinburgh trainers offer progressive courses from basic obedience through specialist activities like scentwork or agility. Always select trainers committed to positive reinforcement methods.

For dogs with significant behaviour challenges, qualified animal behaviourists assess problems comprehensively and create tailored modification programmes. Seek professionals with recognised credentials such as CCAB certification. Your vet can typically recommend behaviourists they trust and collaborate with.

## Making the Right Choices

Finding excellent pet services in Edinburgh requires some research, but the city's strong pet-owning community makes gathering recommendations straightforward. Ask other pet owners, read reviews, and visit facilities before making commitments.

Edinburgh's dog walking community is notably sociable, making parks excellent places to gather recommendations through conversation. Local Facebook groups, community forums, and neighbourhood apps also provide platforms for sharing experiences and seeking advice.

While cost considerations matter, quality should remain the priority. Cheap services sometimes compromise care standards, though expensive options are not automatically superior. Seek genuine value, meaning quality care from qualified professionals at fair prices. Edinburgh has excellent pet service providers ready to care for your companion as well as you do yourself.
